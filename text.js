LangChain v1 is under active development and is not recommended for production use.
APIs may change without notice
The docs are incomplete and subject to change
For the latest stable version, see the v0 LangChain docs.
LangChain is the easiest way to start building with LLMs, letting you get started on building agents with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more in under 10 lines of code.
LangChain agents are built on top of LangGraph in order to provide durable execution, streaming, human-in-the-loop, persistence, and more. You do not need to know LangGraph for basic LangChain agent usage.
